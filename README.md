# Airbnb Final Project
This project explores a cross-sectional comparison of Airbnb and the hotel industry in four US cities (Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco), as well as Airbnb pricing and accommodation patterns for each city. 


## Folders
* __raw_data:__
This folder contains the raw data files for each city that was scraped through the Airbnb site
* __clean_data:__
This folder contains two folders: ***cities_cleaning*** and ***hotels_cleaning***. The ***cities_cleaning*** folder contains ***cleaning_script.Rmd*** that produces the ***updated_cleaned_four_cities.csv*** file, and inside the ***hotels_cleaning*** file, the ***final_hotels.R*** produces the ***cleaned_four_hotels.csv*** file. These csvâ€™s are used for analysis.
