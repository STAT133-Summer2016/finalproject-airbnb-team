## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
la_dbl <- read_csv("la_dbl.csv")
la_dbl <- la_dbl %>%
  mutate(Room.Type ="Private room") %>%
  mutate(City = "Los Angeles") %>%
  mutate(Bed = 2)
colnames(la_dbl)[6] <- "Bed(s)"

la_sgl <- read_csv("la_sgl.csv")
la_sgl <- la_sgl %>%
  mutate(Room.Type ="Private room") %>%
  mutate(City = "Los Angeles") %>%
  mutate(Bed = 1)
colnames(la_sgl)[6] <- "Bed(s)"

la_final <- rbind(la_sgl,la_dbl)
write_csv(la_final, path = "cleaned_la_hotel.csv")
```
